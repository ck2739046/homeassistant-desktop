# Home Assistant - Desktop

Desktop App (Windows / macOS / Linux) for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org)

![Home Assistant - Desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DustyArmstrong/homeassistant-desktop/master/media/screenshot.png)

This project is fork from [iprodanovbg/homeassistant-desktop](https://github.com/iprodanovbg/) and [mrvnklm/homeassistant-desktop](https://github.com/mrvnklm/). 

## Project Status

As of August 2025, the previous version of this project produced by [iprodanovbg](https://github.com/iprodanovbg/) has been archived. Given it is unlikely to return to active development, I will continue to maintain my own version here for as long as people wish to use it. The project is currently in a stable iteration, but I would like to leverage this/a future application to more tightly integrate with Home Assistant itself (device sensors etc.) when I have time. This is highly dependent on my availability, but contributions are welcome. 

I hope this project can be of some use to others if you like/liked the app! Issues are open to submit if you have any, though please be aware I may not be able to resolve all issues quickly or comprehensively - I will do my best.

## Installation

Just download the latest version for your platform from the [release section](https://github.com/DustyArmstrong/homeassistant-desktop/releases/latest) and install!

## Usage / Features

- hover / click the tray icon to open the app
- supports multiple instances of Home Assistant (including automatic switching)
- automatic instance discovery using bonjour
- automatic reconnection to your instance on connection loss
- right-click context menu for settings / reset / quit the app
- global keyboard shortcut (defaults to Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + X but can be changed) can be enabled to show / hide Home Assistant
- fullscreen mode (Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + Return)
- automatic update checks (if not disabled in context menu)

## Notes & known issues

- at present support for self-signed certificates is YMMV (I recommend using Let's Encrypt to resolve this, though it is something I'll try to work on)
- support for Linux distros may vary, app tested on Debian-based flavors (XORG) but detailed feedback is welcome
- support for Wayland is limited - the application will still run however a number of Electron's features aren't implemented yet (e.g. shortcuts, checkbox display)
- if using "detached window" on Windows, instead of dragging, you have to resize it to move it
